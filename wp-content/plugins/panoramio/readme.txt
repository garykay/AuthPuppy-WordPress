Panoramio Condition of use (http://www.panoramio.com/api/widget/api.html#conditions-of-use)

------------

The Panoramio Widget API is free for both commercial and non-commercial purposes that don't exceed the restrictions (http://www.panoramio.com/api/widget/terms.html). However, Panoramio reserves the right to charge fees for the use of Panoramio Widget API for some kind of commercial applications and over certain bandwidth limits. More information at Panoramio Widget API - Terms of Service (http://www.panoramio.com/api/widget/terms.html).

To use the Panoramio Widget API, you must follow these conditions:

Next to every photo or group of photos displayed in your site through the Panoramio Widget API you must show the Panoramio name and logo, and the text "Photos are copyrighted by their owners" or a translation in the site's language.
No more than 50 Panoramio photos can be displayed at a time on one single webpage.
We distinguish between "small" photos, whose largest dimension is less than 500 pixels, and "large" photos, whose largest dimension is more than 499 pixels. The requirements for "small" and "large" photos are different; if you want, you can treat a "small" photo as "large", but not the other way around.
Each "large" photo must show, at least when the mouse is over the photo,
a link to the photo page on the Panoramio.com domain (for example, http://www.panoramio.com/photo/532693),
and a link to the user page on the Panoramio.com domain (for example, http://www.panoramio.com/user/1234) of the photo owner,
and the name of the photo owner.
Each "small" photo must
include a link to the photo page on the Panoramio.com domain,
or make visible, active, or otherwise draw the user to, a photo that complies with the requirements for "large" photos.
This is just a simplified summary of the conditions. Please check the Panoramio Widget API - Terms of Service for detailed requirements.

The Widget API tries to help you comply with the Terms of Service by, for example, automatically adding attribution language at the bottom of each widget. However, remember that it is still your responsibility to comply with the Terms of Service; for example, you are not allowed to use CSS or other techniques to hide the Panoramio logo that is inserted by the Widget API at the appropriate places.
